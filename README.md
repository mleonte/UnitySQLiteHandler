# Unity SQLite Handler

Basic code for a simple ORM for Unity.

Requires Odin if you want the custom editor (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041)

Database tables can be accessed by creating a corresponding wrapper GameObject that derives from Table. See the included ItemType class for an example.

TODO:

- Improve database file placement

- Remove reliance on Odin
